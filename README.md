Background
The purposes of this assignment is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Tools used: Java script, D3 and Plotly
Created a Bar chart, Bubble chart and a demographic drop down feature
